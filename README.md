# Linear-Regression-To-Predict-Outcome-Of-A-Blackbox-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
The objective of this research is to demonstrate that the behavior of the complex machine learning implementations could be predicted using simpler machine learning algorithms. For the purpose of this research, we would be predicting the valence of a song generated using Spotifyâ€™s algorithm. We applied multivariate linear regression on 15 features and iteratively improved the model after reviewing the results to generate our final model that predicted values generated by another machine learning algorithm with a good level of confidence.
